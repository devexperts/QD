/**
 * Main entry class for dxFeed API (<b>read it first</b>).
 *
 * <h3>Sample usage</h3>
 *
 * This section gives sample usage scenarios.
 *
 * <h4>Default singleton instance</h4>
 *
 * There is a singleton instance of the feed that is returned by {@link #getInstance()} method.
 * It is created on the first use with default configuration properties that are explained in detail in
 * documentation for {@link DXEndpoint} class in the
 * "<a href="DXEndpoint.html#defaultPropertiesSection">Default properties</a>"
 *
 * <p>In particular,
 * you can provide a default address to connect and credentials  using
 * "{@link DXEndpoint#DXFEED_ADDRESS_PROPERTY dxfeed.address}",
 * "{@link DXEndpoint#DXFEED_USER_PROPERTY dxfeed.user}", and
 * "{@link DXEndpoint#DXFEED_PASSWORD_PROPERTY dxfeed.password}"
 * system properties or by putting them into
 * "{@link DXEndpoint#DXFEED_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY dxfeed.properties}"
 * file on JVM classpath. dxFeed API samples come with a ready-to-use "<b>dxfeed.properties</b>"
 * file that contains an address of dxFeed demo feed at "<b>demo.dxfeed.com:7300</b>" and
 * demo access credentials.
 *
 * <h4>Subscribe for single event type</h4>
 *
 * The following code creates listener that prints mid price for each quote
 * and subscribes for quotes on SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF symbol:
 * <pre><tt>
 * {@link DXFeedSubscription DXFeedSubscription}&lt;{@link Quote Quote}&gt; sub = {@link DXFeed DXFeed}.{@link #getInstance() getInstance}().{@link #createSubscription(Class) createSubscription}({@link Quote Quote.class});
 * sub.{@link DXFeedSubscription#addEventListener addEventListener}(new {@link DXFeedEventListener DXFeedEventListener}&lt;{@link Quote Quote}&gt;() {
 *     public void eventsReceived({@link List List}&lt;{@link Quote Quote}&gt; quotes) {
 *         for ({@link Quote Quote} quote : quotes)
 *             System.out.println("Mid = " + (quote.{@link Quote#getBidPrice getBidPrice}() + quote.{@link Quote#getAskPrice getAskPrice}()) / 2);
 *     }
 * });
 * sub.{@link DXFeedSubscription#addSymbols(Object...) addSymbols}("SPY");</tt></pre>
 *
 * Note, that order of calls is important here. By attaching listeners first and then setting
 * subscription we ensure that the current quote gets received by the listener. See
 * {@link DXFeedSubscription#addSymbols(Object...) DXFeedSubscription.addSymbols} for details.
 * If a set of symbols is changed first, then {@link DXFeedSubscription#addEventListener(DXFeedEventListener) sub.addEventListener}
 * raises an {@link IllegalStateException} to protected from hard-to-catch bugs with potentially missed events.
 *
 * <h4>Subscribe for multiple event types</h4>
 *
 * The following code creates listener that prints each received event and
 * subscribes for quotes and trades on SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF symbol:
 * <pre><tt>
 * {@link DXFeedSubscription DXFeedSubscription}&lt;{@link MarketEvent MarketEvent}&gt; sub = {@link DXFeed DXFeed}.{@link #getInstance() getInstance}().&lt;{@link MarketEvent MarketEvent}&gt;{@link #createSubscription(Class[]) createSubscription}({@link Quote Quote.class}, {@link Trade Trade.class});
 * sub.{@link DXFeedSubscription#addEventListener addEventListener}(new {@link DXFeedEventListener DXFeedEventListener}&lt;{@link MarketEvent MarketEvent}&gt;() {
 *     public void eventsReceived({@link List List}&lt;{@link MarketEvent MarketEvent}&gt; events) {
 *         for ({@link MarketEvent MarketEvent} event : events)
 *             System.out.println(event);
 *     }
 * });
 * sub.{@link DXFeedSubscription#addSymbols(Object...) addSymbols}("SPY");</tt></pre>
 *
 * <h4>Subscribe for event and query periodically its last value</h4>
 *
 * The following code subscribes for trades on SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF symbol and
 * prints last trade every second.
 *
 * <pre><tt>
 * {@link DXFeedSubscription DXFeedSubscription}&lt;{@link Trade Trade}&gt; sub = {@link DXFeed DXFeed}.{@link #getInstance() getInstance}().{@link #createSubscription(Class) createSubscription}({@link Trade Trade.class});
 * sub.{@link DXFeedSubscription#addSymbols(Object...) addSymbols}("SPY");
 * while (true) {
 *     System.out.println(feed.{@link #getLastEvent getLastEvent}(new Trade("SPY")));
 *     Thread.sleep(1000);
 * }</tt></pre>
 *
 * <h3>Threads and locks</h3>
 *
 * This class is thread-safe and can be used concurrently from multiple threads without external synchronization.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation details</h3>
 *
 * dxFeed API is implemented on top of QDS. dxFeed API classes itself are in "<b>dxfeed-api.jar</b>", but
 * their implementation is in "<b>qds.jar</b>". You need have "<b>qds.jar</b>" in your classpath
 * in order to use dxFeed API.

     * is always zero.
     *
     * <p>Note, that the resulting list <em>should not</em> be used with
     * {@link DXPublisher#publishEvents(Collection) DXPublisher.publishEvents} method, because the later expects

     * Returns a list of indexed events for the specified event type, symbol, and source
     * if there is a subscription for it.
     * This method works only for event types that implement {@link IndexedEvent} interface.
     * This method <b>does not</b> make any remote calls to the uplink data provider.
     * It just retrieves last received events from the local cache of this feed.
     * The events are stored in the cache only if there is some
     * attached {@link DXFeedSubscription} that is subscribed to the corresponding event type, symbol, and source.
     * The subscription can also be permanently defined using {@link DXEndpoint DXEndpoint} properties.
     * If there is no subscription, then this method returns null.
     * Otherwise, it creates a list of events of the specified {@code eventType} and returns it.
     * The events are ordered by {@link IndexedEvent#getIndex() index} in the list.
     *
     * <p>If there is a subscription, but the events have not arrived from the uplink data provider,

     *
     * Use the {@link IndexedEventSource#DEFAULT DEFAULT} value for {@code source} with events that do not
     * have multiple sources (like {@link Series}). For events with multiple sources (like {@link Order},
     * {@link AnalyticOrder}, {@link OtcMarketsOrder}, {@link NuamOrder} and {@link SpreadOrder}), use an event-specific
     * source class (for example, {@link OrderSource}).
     * This method does not support <em>synthetic</em> sources of orders (orders that are automatically
