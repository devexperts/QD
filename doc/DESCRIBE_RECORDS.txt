Specification for DESCRIBE_RECORDS message.

Each application communicating over QTP protocol SHOULD send one or
more DESCRIBE_RECORDS message before sending any data that references
specific record identifiers. Communication in each direction is
independent. For example, consider application that subscribes to
ticker data via TICKER_ADD_SUBSCRIPTION message. Before sending
subscription application shall crate DESCRIBE_RECORDS packet with all
the record identifiers. One or multiple DESCRIBE_RECORDS MAY be sent.
They MAY be sent only as needed or in advance right after
establishment of connection. Subsequent DESCRIBE_RECORDS message MAY
replace previously assigned record identifiers with new ones.

Application that responds to TICKER_ADD_SUBSCRIPTION message with
TICKER_DATA message SHOULD send its own DESCRIBE_RECORDS message that
MAY establish different correspondence for record identifiers in
TICKER_DATA messages that is will be sending.

The structure of DESCRIBE_RECORDS message is:

message_length :: COMPACT_INT       // message length in bytes
message_type   :: COMPACT_INT == 2  // DESCRIBE_RECORDS message id
... followed by zero or more record descriptors

The structure of each record descriptor is:

record_id      :: COMPACT_INT       // may not be negative
record_name    :: UTF_STRING        // may not be null or empty
record_fcount  :: COMPACT_INT       // may not be negative
... followed by record_fcount field descriptors

The structure of each field descriptor is:
field_name     :: UTF_STRING       // may not be null or empty
field_type     :: COMPACT_INT      // must be from 0 to 255 inclusive

Lowest (least significant) 4 bits of field_type denote a
serialization type of the corresponding field:

0     -- VOID           // no bytes are serialized
1     -- BYTE           // exactly one byte
2     -- UTF_CHAR       // from 1 to 4 bytes
3     -- SHORT          // exactly 2 bytes
4     -- INT            // exactly 4 bytes
5,6,7 -- reserved       // invalid
8     -- COMPACT_INT    // from 1 to 9 bytes (may be long)
9     -- BYTE_ARRAY     // COMPACT_INT size followed by BYTEs
10    -- UTF_CHAR_ARRAY // COMPACT_INT size followed by UTF_CHARs
11-15 -- reserved       // invalid

It is a protocol error if parsed contents of DESCRIBE_RECORDS message
do not conform to the above requirements or contain reserved
serialization types. Connection SHOULD be dropped in this case.

Bits from 4th to 7th of field_type denote a representation of
the corresponding field value. They affect value output for debugging
purposes and interpretation of value by application.

0x000  -- PLAIN         // applicable all field types
0x010  -- DECIMAL       // applicable to all integral field types
0x020  -- SHORT_STRING  // applicable to all integral field types
0x030  -- TIME          // applicable to all integral field types
0x040  -- SEQUENCE      // applicable to all integral field types
0x050  -- DATE          // applicable to all integral field types
0x080  -- STRING        // applicable to BYTE_ARRAY
0x0e0  -- CUSTOM_OBJECT // applicable to BYTE_ARRAY
0x0f0  -- SERIAL_OBJECT // applicable to BYTE_ARRAY

Unsupported values in those bits are reserved for backwards compatible
extensions and MUST be ignored. Such field SHOULD be treated as PLAIN.

Bits from 8th and above of field_type are reserved for non backwards compatible
extensions. It is a protocol error if those bits are non-zero. Connection
SHOULD be dropped in this case.

* PLAIN fields SHOULD be treated according to their serialization
type. BYTE, SHORT, INT, COMPACT_INT as signed integers, UTF_CHAR as
character, BYTE_ARRAY as an arbitrary byte array, UTF_CHAR_ARRAY as a
string of characters.

* DECIMAL fields SHOULD be treated as decimal encoding of the floating
point number into a integer. In decimal encoding lower 4 bits
represent power of the exponent and the rest of the bits represent
signed mantissa (see javadoc of com.devexperts.qd.util.Decimal class).

* SHORT_STRING fields SHOULD be treated as an encoding of a string
with up to 4 8-bit characters into an integer.

* TIME fields SHOULD be treated as a time in seconds since the
beginning of the Unix epoch (unix time).

* SEQUENCE fields SHOULD be treated as an integer with highest 10
bits representing milliseconds of the preceding TIME field.

* DATE fields SHOULD be treated as a day number since the beginning of
the Unix epoch.

* STRING fields should be treated as UTF8 encoding of a string into a
byte array.

* CUSTOM_OBJECT fields should be treated as custom
application-specific serialization of some object into a byte array.

* SERIAL_OBJECT fields should be treated as Java standard
serialization of an object into a byte array.

Application that subscribes for data SHOULD list all fields with their
names and types that it expects to receive, but it MUST be prepared to
receive and parse an arbitrary descriptor of the corresponding record
from the data source. Having received the descriptors from the data
source it MUST parse and store them, so that it can read all the
described fields for each record according to their serialization
type.

Applications that expect numeric data in the fields (either integral
or decimal) SHOULD be ready to parse and interpret all of the
following serialization types:

VOID        -- assume the received integer value is 0.
BYTE        -- 1 byte signed integer.
UTF_CHAR    -- 1 to 4 bytes unsigned integer.
SHORT       -- 2 bytes signed integer.
INT         -- 4 bytes signed integer.
COMPACT_INT -- 1 to 9 bytes signed integer.

Applications SHOULD also be ready to interpret the following
representation types with all of the above serialization types:

PLAIN       -- interpret integer as received
DECIMAL     -- interpret as decimal-packed number
