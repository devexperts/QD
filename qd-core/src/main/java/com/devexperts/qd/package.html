This package contains basic interfaces and other API elements of QD system
which shall be sufficient for the client application programmer.
<p>
The general API of QD falls into several categories:
<ul>
<li><b>Data definition API.</b> It includes {@link com.devexperts.qd.DataIntField}, {@link com.devexperts.qd.DataObjField},
{@link com.devexperts.qd.DataRecord}, {@link com.devexperts.qd.DataScheme} and {@link com.devexperts.qd.SymbolCodec} (with {@link com.devexperts.qd.SymbolReceiver}).
<li><b>Data transfer API.</b> It includes {@link com.devexperts.qd.DataIterator}, {@link com.devexperts.qd.DataVisitor},
{@link com.devexperts.qd.DataConsumer}, {@link com.devexperts.qd.DataProvider} (with {@link com.devexperts.qd.DataListener}) and {@link com.devexperts.qd.DataBuffer}.
<li><b>Subscription transfer API.</b> It includes {@link com.devexperts.qd.SubscriptionIterator}, {@link com.devexperts.qd.SubscriptionVisitor},
{@link com.devexperts.qd.SubscriptionConsumer}, {@link com.devexperts.qd.SubscriptionProvider} (with {@link com.devexperts.qd.SubscriptionListener}) and {@link com.devexperts.qd.SubscriptionBuffer}.
<li><b>Subscription filtering API.</b> It includes {@link com.devexperts.qd.SubscriptionFilter}.
<li><b>Consumer representation API.</b> It includes {@link com.devexperts.qd.QDAgent}.
<li><b>Provider representation API.</b> It includes {@link com.devexperts.qd.QDDistributor}.
<li><b>QD component API.</b> It includes {@link com.devexperts.qd.QDCollector},
{@link com.devexperts.qd.QDTicker}, {@link com.devexperts.qd.QDStream}, {@link com.devexperts.qd.QDHistory} and {@link com.devexperts.qd.QDFactory}.
</ul>
The specific APIs of QD required to create and operate specific subsystems
are defined in other packages.
<p>
Most APIs have default implementations for common cases; these are placed according
to their classification. See individual packages for details.
