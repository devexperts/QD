JSPC Maven Plugin
=================

This is a fork of Jetty JSPC Maven Plugin http://mojo.codehaus.org/jspc/jspc-maven-plugin/ with support for JSP files that does not have ".jsp" extension and
are manually mapped to "jsp" servlet via "servlet-mapping" in "web.xml" file. 

See http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Maven+Jetty+Jspc+Plugin for original instructions on using this plugin.
